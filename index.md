## CGPart: A Part Segmentation Dataset Based on 3D Computer Graphics Models

CGPart is a comprehensive part segmentation dataset that provides detailed annotations on 3D CAD models, synthetic images, and real test images. CGPart includes 21 3D CAD models covering 5 vehicle categories, each with detailed per-mesh part labeling. By varying the rendering parameters, we make a large scale synthetic image dataset from these CAD models, each with automatically generated part segmentation ground-truth. We also annotate part segmentations on 200 real images for evaluation purposes.

Below are some example segmentation annotations from the dataset.
